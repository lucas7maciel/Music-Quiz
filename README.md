This React App uses the Last.fm api to generate random questions based on your records stored on the site, such as "Which of these is your most listened to album?".

During the process of creating the site, I learned the syntax and operation of React (components, refs, states, etc). In addition, I was able to improve my knowledge in JavaScript and CSS for code optimization and new features, such as animations or manipulation of objects and components.
